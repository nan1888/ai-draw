# Fill AI Image Holder

Use this skill for the first image-generation loop in ai-draw. The user should be able to say a normal request, not tool names.

## Tool Availability Gate

This workflow must use the ai-draw MCP tools. If `generate_image_into_holder` is available, prefer it because it calls the configured external async image API and inserts the image in one step. If it is not available, fall back to `prepare_image_generation`, `insert_image_into_holder`, and `save_snapshot`.

If neither `generate_image_into_holder` nor the fallback tool set is callable in the current Codex thread, stop and tell the user:

```text
ai-draw 插件已经识别到，但工具没有加载出来。如果你刚安装或刚更新过插件，请完全退出并重新打开 Codex，再发送同一句需求；插件不需要重新安装。
```

Do not inspect plugin files, run `curl`, check ports, start local services by hand, or recreate HTTP calls during a normal image-generation request. Those actions are only for explicit plugin development/debugging.

## Workflow

1. If `generate_image_into_holder` is callable, call it with the user's original request. If it returns `ok: true`, it used the configured NewAPI async image endpoint, downloaded the image, inserted it, and saved the canvas; then skip to step 9. If it returns `needsFallback: true`, use its `suggestedPrompt`, `outputDir`, and `holderShapeId` and continue from step 5 with Codex image generation.
2. If `generate_image_into_holder` is not callable, call `prepare_image_generation` with the user's original request.
3. Choose an aspect ratio when missing:
   - 横版广告, banner, 封面头图: `16:9`.
   - 小红书封面, 竖版广告, poster: `5:7`.
   - 头像, 方图, product square: `1:1`.
   - Unknown: `5:7`.
4. If the returned result includes a canvas URL, show it as a clickable link. Do not open external Chrome, headless Chrome, shell `open`, or Browser automation to connect the canvas.
5. Generate the image using the available Codex image-generation capability and the returned `suggestedPrompt`. If the user asked for text, typography, title design, poster lettering, or brand words, let image 2.0 design those directly in the image.
6. Do not create a separate local text overlay, Python/PIL composition, second layout pass, or alternate final image unless the user explicitly asks for it or the image tool did not produce a usable local image.
7. Save the generated image under the returned output directory when the image tool provides a file or downloadable result.
8. Call `insert_image_into_holder` with the holder id and local image path, then call `save_snapshot`.
9. Tell the user the image is inserted, then clearly hand off to canvas work: "现在请打开画布标注，标完一批后点“按标注修图”。我会在这里等按钮，不是还在生成。"
10. Continue with the `auto-ai-canvas-edit-mode` workflow by polling `process_next_edit_request` when available, otherwise `watch_edit_requests`, until the user says to stop, the Codex app/thread is closed, the task is interrupted, or a blocking clarification is required.

## User-Facing Tone

Say what is happening like a product assistant:

- "我先确认画布里的图片框。"
- "我会生成图片并放进当前图片框。"
- "图片已经放进画布。现在请去画布上画箭头和文字，标完一批后点“按标注修图”。"
- "我会继续等你点“按标注修图”，这不是卡住，也不是还在生成。"

Do not expose MCP JSON, shape IDs, or file paths unless the user asks for debugging details.

## Canvas Opening Rule

Do not launch an external browser window, hidden Chrome, headless Chrome, shell `open`, or Browser automation. Show the returned local URL as a clickable link and let the user open it inside Codex's side panel. Browser automation is for testing only.

If the canvas page is not open, keep the generation flow simple: generate the image, save it, insert it through the ai-draw service, and let the service queue the visual update until the user opens the canvas.
